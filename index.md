# Donnie Darko
On October 2, 1988, in the small town of Middlesex, Virginia, troubled teenager Donnie Darko, led by a mysterious voice, sleepwalks out of his home. Once outside, he meets a figure in a monstrous rabbit costume who introduces himself as Frank and tells Donnie that the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds. Donnie wakes up the next morning on a local golf course and returns home to discover a jet engine has crashed into his bedroom. His older sister Elizabeth tells him the FAA investigators do not know its origin. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donnie_Darko#Plot)
